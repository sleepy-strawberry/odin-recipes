    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber
      of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from
      the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk
      added or not. One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne
      sheets. These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without
      garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to
      pre-boil it.
